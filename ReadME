Reentry Portal – Demo Login Instructions

Overview

This is a demo login page for testing purposes. Accounts and login status are stored locally in your browser. No server or real authentication is required.

How to Use
1. Create an Account

Click the “Create Account” button.

Enter a new username when prompted.

Enter a password when prompted.

Your account is saved locally and can now be used to log in.


⚠️ If an account does not exist on your browser, you will need to create one.


2. Log In

Enter your username and password in the input fields.

Click “Sign In”.

If the credentials match a local account, you’ll be redirected to the demo dashboard (Reentry/index.html).

If credentials are invalid, an alert will notify you.

Notes

Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

Do not use real passwords—this demo stores credentials in plain localStorage.
